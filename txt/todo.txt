1. Create mini makefile
2. Create mini tinyshell.h with structs (combine with J's later)
	-env path struct in t_data ->copy from J but make smaller version
3. Understand how cmd->arg.str works
4. Test preliminary version of export (without accounting for special characters)
5. Test preliminary version of echo
6. adjust ft_calloc, ft_split so it exits on malloc error and frees all structs
