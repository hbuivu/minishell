First things to do 
- create env variables in a way that make sense
	-original idea was to create a linked list of variables
	-each variable has a linked list of values
	-it was going to be an array of strings at first but that seemed incomplete
-create builtin prototypes

-simplifying env variables. Now it will be char *var and char *value
-when we need individual vals, we can split up the values as needed
-path will be separate element in the struct
-also need to update J's our_env -> create a function for this
